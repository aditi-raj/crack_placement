# 45 Days DSA Challenge
Welcome to the 45 Days DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Challenge! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I work through various DSA problems over the next 45 days.

## Overview
The goal of this challenge is to improve my understanding and proficiency in data structures and algorithms by solving a variety of problems each day. This will help me prepare for technical interviews and enhance my problem-solving skills.

The repository is organized as follows:
Day 1 to Day 45: Each day has its own folder containing the problems solved on that day.
